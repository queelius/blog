# Trump’s Russian Connections – Investigative Findings

## Money Laundering Through Trump Properties  
**Claim:** Trump-owned or branded properties were used to launder money, particularly for Russian criminals/oligarchs.  

**Evidence:** Multiple financial records and legal actions support this claim. For example, the Trump Taj Mahal casino admitted to “willfully” violating anti-money-laundering (AML) laws from 2010-2012 and was fined $10 million by FinCEN ([Trump Taj Mahal casino settles U.S. money laundering claims | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-taj-mahal-casino-settles-us-money-laundering-claims-idUSL1N0VL2L1/#:~:text=In%20exchange%2C%20Trump%20Taj%20Mahal,Act%20from%202010%20to%202012)) ([Trump Taj Mahal casino settles U.S. money laundering claims | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-taj-mahal-casino-settles-us-money-laundering-claims-idUSL1N0VL2L1/#:~:text=%245%2C000%20or%20larger)). Earlier, in 1984, Russian mob associate David Bogatin paid \$6 million cash for five condos in Trump Tower – in 1987 he pleaded guilty in a massive gasoline-tax fraud and fled the U.S. **The government seized his Trump Tower condos, calling them laundered assets used to “shelter and hide” illicit funds ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI)).** A Senate probe later identified Bogatin as a key figure in the Russian mafia, with ties to Semion Mogilevich – one of Russia’s top crime bosses ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=that%20he%20had%20purchased%20them,international%20criminal%20syndicate%20into%20America)). These examples show Trump properties attracted buyers later unmasked as criminals laundering money.  

More recent transactions raise similar red flags. **In 2008, Trump sold a Palm Beach mansion to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for \$95 million – more than double what Trump paid just four years prior ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=larger%20six,estate%20record%20at%20the%20time)).** Rybolovlev never lived in the home and later demolished it, heightening suspicions that the deal was not a normal investment ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Rybolovlev%2C%20who%20made%20his%20estimated,lots%2C%20and%20selling%20them%20off)). Likewise, Trump-branded luxury condos in New York, Florida, and abroad were often purchased through anonymous shell companies. A 2017 Reuters investigation found **at least 63 Russian buyers (with Russian passports or addresses) spent nearly \$100 million on Trump-branded condos in south Florida alone ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records))**. Many units were bought via LLCs that hid true owners, a practice experts note is common in real-estate money laundering ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20tally%20of%20investors%20from,not%20included%20in%20the%20tally)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20organization%20advertises%20all,from%20the%20buildings%20is%20unclear)). While Reuters “found no suggestion of wrongdoing by President Trump” in those specific sales ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20Reuters%20review%20of%20investors,to%20be%20from%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20inner)), the pattern is consistent with illicit finance: **high-end property purchased through opaque entities, often in cash.**  

Several legal filings explicitly link Trump-branded projects to money laundering by ex-Soviet figures. In a 2019 civil case, Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank alleged that Trump’s longtime business associate Felix Sater (of Bayrock Group) helped a Kazakh official’s son launder \$3 million in stolen funds by disguising them as purchases of Trump SoHo condos ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=international%20money%20laundering%20scheme%20involving,11)). (Sater, a convicted felon with mafia ties, had co-developed Trump SoHo.) Trump’s Panama City project also became a magnet for dirty money: Colombian cartel boss David H. Murcia Guzmán and associates bought numerous units with laundered drug funds, and a key broker for the project estimated that **“50% of his customers were Russian,” including some later found to be part of the Russian mafia ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Attracting%20Russian%20and%20Eastern%20European,posed%20major%20money%20laundering%20risks)) ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=In%20his%20interview%20with%20NBC,part%20of%20the%20Russian%20Mafia)).** One Panama broker admitted Russian and Eastern European buyers at the Trump Ocean Club would set up secretive shell companies so “you don’t know their names” or sources of money ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=know%2C%20questionable%20backgrounds,part%20of%20the%20Russian%20Mafia)).  

**Strength of Evidence:** The evidence for chronic money laundering through Trump properties is considerable. U.S. enforcement actions (e.g. FinCEN’s penalty) and court documents substantiate that Trump businesses had **repeated AML failures and attracted criminal money ([Trump Taj Mahal casino settles U.S. money laundering claims | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-taj-mahal-casino-settles-us-money-laundering-claims-idUSL1N0VL2L1/#:~:text=In%20exchange%2C%20Trump%20Taj%20Mahal,Act%20from%202010%20to%202012)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI))**. Multiple investigative reports and expert analyses have documented dozens of suspicious transactions – from the 1980s (Trump Tower condos bought by mobsters) to the 2010s (condos and projects linked to Russian and post-Soviet oligarchs and criminals). Financial crime experts note that this fits a broader historical **pattern of criminals using luxury real estate to clean money ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=criminal%20enterprises,built%2C%20as%20David%20Cay%20Johnston))**, and Trump’s high-end developments (which for years openly welcomed anonymous cash buyers) were an optimal vehicle. The sheer volume of such deals (e.g. tens of millions in condos to Kremlin-linked figures ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records))) bolsters the claim.  

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** While the **transactions are well documented**, direct evidence of Trump’s personal knowledge or intent to enable money laundering is not public. The Trump Organization often claims it simply sold units and cannot be blamed if buyers turn out corrupt. Indeed, the Reuters review noted no proof that Trump *actively* participated in or knew of laundering in the Florida condo sales ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20Reuters%20review%20of%20investors,to%20be%20from%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20inner)). Much evidence comes from patterns and circumstantial links (e.g. selling at inflated prices, accepting opaque buyers) rather than a proverbial “smoking gun” email or confession. Thus, the **main uncertainty is intent**: whether Trump willfully facilitated illicit money flows or simply exercised poor due diligence while welcoming any cash-rich buyer. Investigators have flagged these patterns as *highly* suspicious, but final legal conclusions (if any) remain pending.  

## Russian Intelligence Cultivation of Trump as an “Asset”  
**Claim:** Russian security services (and previously the Soviet KGB) sought to cultivate Donald Trump as an intelligence asset or ally over decades.  

**Evidence:** This claim is supported by accounts from former Soviet bloc intelligence officials and Cold War records. In 1987, Trump made his first trip to Moscow, ostensibly to explore building a hotel. According to Yuri Shvets – a former KGB major stationed in Washington – the Soviet **KGB actively courted Trump during this visit, feeding him flattery and business incentives as “an ideal target” for cultivation ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D))**. Shvets, a key source for journalist Craig Unger’s 2021 book, says the KGB developed Trump as a prospective asset and **even circulated an internal cable in 1987 celebrating a “newly cultivated American” who had begun advancing Soviet-favored views ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D))**. Indeed, shortly after returning from Moscow, Trump took out full-page U.S. newspaper ads echoing positions critical of U.S. alliances and urging a retreat from Japan and NATO – stances that *“proved so willing to parrot anti-Western propaganda that there were celebrations in Moscow,”* Shvets told The Guardian ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D)).  Soviet intelligence apparently saw Trump’s ego and business woes as vulnerabilities to exploit. A former KGB operative recalled that Trump’s “vanity and narcissism made him a natural target” and that the KGB played to his desire for praise ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D)). 

During the post-Soviet era, Russian security services (FSB/GRU) continued efforts to ingratiate themselves with Trump. Unger and others point to Trump’s lucrative partnerships with Russian oligarchs and mob-tied ex-Soviets as *potential conduits* for Kremlin influence ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=awareness%20that%20Russian%20and%20other,intelligence%20assets%20and%20compromising%20them)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)). For instance, **Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov cultivated a friendly relationship with Trump**, hosting his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 and later helping arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Kremlin. While Trump was never an intelligence officer or agent in a formal sense, experts suggest Moscow viewed him as an asset in the colloquial sense: a prominent individual whose **financial and political interests aligned enough with Russia’s that he could be influenced or persuaded to support Kremlin objectives** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=awareness%20that%20Russian%20and%20other,intelligence%20assets%20and%20compromising%20them)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)). 

U.S. intelligence assessments confirm that Russia made unusual efforts to court and assist Trump during the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community’s January 2017 report concluded that **Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to interfere in the election *“and developed a clear preference for President-elect Donald Trump”* ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=since%20he%20became%20President,elect%20Donald%20Trump.%E2%80%9D)).** The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review went further, describing the Trump campaign’s Russian contacts in 2016 as a “grave” counterintelligence threat ([Senate panel finds Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election#:~:text=Senate%20panel%20finds%20Russia%20interfered,counterintelligence%20threat%2C%20a%20Senate)). For example, Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort had repeated communications with a man the Senate report identified as a Russian intelligence officer, sharing internal polling data ([Senate panel finds Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election#:~:text=Senate%20panel%20finds%20Russia%20interfered,counterintelligence%20threat%2C%20a%20Senate)). Such interactions exemplify Russian tradecraft in trying to develop leverage over influential foreigners. Former FBI counterintelligence officials have said that Trump’s pattern of praise for Putin and receptiveness to pro-Russia policy ideas (like easing sanctions) is **consistent with an influence target responding to cultivation**, whether due to business dependencies or kompromat. In fact, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence inquiry into whether the president *“was working on behalf of Russia against American interests,”* an extraordinary step underscoring their suspicions (reported by _The New York Times_) ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%2C%20Adam%20Schiff%2C,made%20about%20alleged%20money%20laundering)) ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)).  

**Strength of Evidence:** The notion of Trump being groomed by Russian intelligence relies largely on credible testimony from former insiders like Shvets and on documented behavioral patterns. Shvets’ account (corroborated by another ex-KGB officer from Kazakhstan, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed Trump was given the code name “Krasnov” in 1987 ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=Mussayev%20who%20claimed%20that%20he,then%20USSR%20KGB%20in%20Moscow)) ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20Mussayev,facts%20published%20in%20the%20media))) provides a firsthand Soviet perspective and aligns with Trump’s observable actions (e.g. his 1987 policy ads). Additionally, the extraordinary lengths Russia went to in 2016 to help Trump – from hacking Democrats to directly reaching out to his circle – are confirmed by multiple intelligence investigations ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=since%20he%20became%20President,elect%20Donald%20Trump.%E2%80%9D)). The **convergence of independent strands** (Cold War KGB tactics and 2016 election interference) gives weight to the claim that Trump was seen by Moscow as someone worth cultivating over many years. Senior U.S. intelligence veterans have publicly voiced that Trump’s behavior fits the profile of an influenced individual; for example, former CIA Director John Brennan remarked in 2018 that Trump’s submissiveness to Putin suggested he could be compromised (though Brennan did not present proof in public).  

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** Despite these indications, **hard evidence (such as original KGB files or a “smoking gun” proving Trump knowingly acted as a Russian agent) has not been made public.** Much of the long-term cultivation claim rests on testimony of ex-Soviet spies (which, while valuable, is difficult to independently verify without declassified documents). U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed Russian *efforts* to influence Trump, but **they have not officially labeled Trump as a recruited asset**. Even the Mueller investigation, which documented extensive contacts and Russia’s election meddling, did not allege that Trump himself conspired with Russian intelligence (and Mueller did not investigate the 1980s links). Thus, uncertainties remain about the depth of Trump’s relationship with Russian handlers: Was he an unwitting influencer, a “useful idiot” swayed by flattery and business deals, or something more deliberate? The lack of a definitive government assessment on this point means the claim, while supported by many intriguing pieces, cannot be stated as incontrovertible fact. It is a strong suspicions-based narrative with **insider testimony and circumstantial evidence**, but not a formally proven case by Western intelligence to date.  

## Testimonies from Experts and Insiders  
**Claim:** Seasoned financial crime experts, intelligence professionals, and journalists have testified to or reported on Trump’s extensive ties to Russian organized crime and related illicit finance. Their accounts reinforce the above claims.  

**Evidence:** One of the most direct sources is **Glenn Simpson**, a former investigative journalist and co-founder of Fusion GPS. Simpson was hired in 2016 to research Trump’s Russia links and later testified to Congress about his findings. In a 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee interview (released in 2018), Simpson described patterns suggesting “the Trump Organization may have engaged in money laundering with Russian nationals” ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)). He noted that **many Trump properties were sold to mystery buyers from Russia or the former USSR, often in cash transactions**, and testified that such patterns are “highly suggestive of money laundering” and warranted further investigation ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%2C%20Adam%20Schiff%2C,made%20about%20alleged%20money%20laundering)) ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)). According to Simpson, his research found “enormous amounts of capital flowing from Russia” into Trump’s ventures, and he pointed lawmakers toward specific deals (like Trump SoHo and the Florida projects) that looked suspicious. His testimony was considered so concerning that Rep. Adam Schiff later said it **“reveal[s] serious allegations”** of Trump’s business being used for laundering money by Russians ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)). This aligns with remarks by **Steve Bannon (Trump’s ex-chief strategist)**, who was quoted as saying the real issue is “money laundering” and that investigators would be following the money trail – a point Simpson highlighted as well ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)).  

Financial crime experts have echoed these concerns outside of Congress. **British-American financier Bill Browder**, who exposed the $230 million Russian fraud behind the Magnitsky case, has pointed out that **oligarchs often launder money through Western real estate** and publicly speculated that some of Trump’s deals (like the Rybolovlev mansion sale) merited scrutiny under this lens. Former DOJ official **David Kris** (who once led the National Security Division) explained how Russian intelligence leverages financial leverage or kompromat to recruit assets, implicitly framing Trump’s heavy reliance on Russian money as a security risk ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=awareness%20that%20Russian%20and%20other,intelligence%20assets%20and%20compromising%20them)). Another expert, Jonathan Winer (a Clinton-era State Department official over international law enforcement), noted that during the 1990s **“criminals would use condos and high-rises to launder money”** – he specifically cited Trump Tower as one of the early NYC buildings that accepted anonymous buyers, facilitating this practice ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=criminal%20enterprises,Trump%2C%20it%20was%20only%20the)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,His%20brother%20ran%20a%20%24150)). Such testimony underlines that what was happening in Trump’s orbit was not in isolation but fits a known criminal typology.  

Investigative journalists have also provided testimony in the form of deeply researched exposés. For instance, veteran reporters at **Reuters, Bloomberg, and The New York Times** have tracked Trump’s business deals: Reuters confirmed the large influx of Russian condo buyers in Trump projects ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)), and Bloomberg reported on Trump’s partnership with Bayrock, a company **“widely suspected of being a front for money laundering”** and funded by Eastern European oligarchs ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=convinced%20that%20the%20firm%20was,a%20front%20for%20money%20laundering)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Precisely%20where%20Bayrock%E2%80%99s%20other%20money,family%20chromium%20business%20in%20Kazakhstan)). Author **Craig Unger** (whose research we are essentially reviewing) compiled interviews with ex-spies and mafia figures to document a 40-year timeline of Trump’s Russian entanglements. His work (in _House of Trump, House of Putin_ and _American Kompromat_) includes interviews with people like **Felix Sater**, who affirmed that the Trump SoHo project had backing from illicit funds, and with **Yuri Shvets**, who provided the KGB perspective. Major news organizations have vetted and echoed many of Unger’s claims: e.g. _The Guardian_ in 2021 reported Shvets’s assertions in detail ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D)), and _The New Republic_ (2017) published Unger’s outline of Trump’s “Russian Laundromat,” referencing court records, corporate filings, and FBI reports that **tie Trump to at least **59** Russian money intermediaries over decades ([Book Alleges Trump is Compromised by Russian Mafia](https://therealnews.com/book-alleges-trump-is-compromised-by-russian-mafia#:~:text=mafia,five%20years)) ([Book Alleges Trump is Compromised by Russian Mafia](https://therealnews.com/book-alleges-trump-is-compromised-by-russian-mafia#:~:text=back%20many%20years%20looking%20at,the%20overarching%20story%20on%20that)).** In short, a broad array of professionals – from congressional witnesses to journalists and intelligence veterans – have publicly raised alarms that **Trump’s businesses and campaign were deeply enmeshed with Russian illicit actors**. 

**Strength of Evidence:** The consistency of these testimonies across different domains (legal, intelligence, media) strengthens the credibility of the overall narrative. Simpson’s sworn testimony provides granular detail and is backed by documents he supplied to investigators, lending it weight ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%2C%20Adam%20Schiff%2C,made%20about%20alleged%20money%20laundering)) ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)). Expert analyses (like Winer’s and Kris’s) give historical and methodological context – they confirm that the patterns seen (cash purchases, shell companies, flattery-for-influence) are classic red flags in their fields ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=criminal%20enterprises,built%2C%20as%20David%20Cay%20Johnston)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)). Journalistic investigations, often based on public records and on-record interviews, corroborate each other; for example, **Don Jr.’s 2008 statement** that “**Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of [Trump Organization] assets… We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia**” is reported in multiple outlets ([Donald Trump Jr. in 2008 Said a Lot of Trump Assets Were in Russia - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2#:~:text=resurfaced%20on%20Sunday%20in%20a,ed%20article)) and essentially confirms the core premise in Trump’s own words. When independent experts and insiders all point to the same conclusion – that **Trump’s financial world was unusually saturated with Russian money and mob connections** – it bolsters the claim’s validity.  

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** These testimonies, while compelling, are not final adjudications. Some, like Simpson’s, were partisan flashpoints – critics note Fusion GPS was hired by opponents of Trump, potentially biasing its findings (though Simpson maintains his facts are documented). Journalistic reports sometimes rely on anonymous sources or inferential links that skeptics dispute. Importantly, none of these experts had access to all of Trump’s financial records (Trump never released his tax returns during the investigations), so they often concede that **full proof may lie in records still concealed**. There’s also the matter of ongoing investigations: for instance, Special Counsel Mueller examined some of these issues but kept a narrow focus on criminal conspiracy related to the election, not broader financial entanglements – meaning many allegations of laundering were not conclusively probed in court. Consequently, while expert testimony raises serious concerns and lines of inquiry, certain details remain unverified. For example, **we have allegations (Simpson’s, Bannon’s) that Trump Org was laundering money, but to date no formal charge of money laundering has been brought against Trump Org in a U.S. court**. The lack of a court-tested conclusion means we must characterize these as allegations supported by substantial evidence, yet not proven beyond doubt.  

## Russian Organized Crime and Western Real Estate – Historical Pattern  
**Context:** A key backdrop to these specific claims is the well-documented pattern of Russian (and post-Soviet) organized crime using Western real estate to hide illicit wealth. Understanding this pattern gives context to Trump’s dealings.  

**Evidence:** Since the 1990s, law enforcement agencies have observed that corrupt Russian oligarchs and mobsters frequently launder money by purchasing luxury properties abroad. **High-end real estate provides a stable store of value and, until recently, allowed anonymous ownership, making it ideal for cleaning dirty money** ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=criminal%20enterprises,Trump%2C%20it%20was%20only%20the)). Jonathan Winer, as noted, described how during the ’80s and ’90s condos became “systematic” money laundromats for criminals, who didn’t mind overpaying because the resale would legitimize their funds ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=criminal%20enterprises,built%2C%20as%20David%20Cay%20Johnston)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=reports%20in%20The%20Making%20of,York%20that%20accepted%20anonymous%20buyers)). This phenomenon earned London the nickname “Londongrad” and similarly affected New York, Miami, and other major cities. 

U.S. legal cases bear this out. In 2013, federal prosecutors in New York **indicted 34 members of a Russian-American crime ring for laundering over \$100 million in criminal proceeds through shell companies, offshore accounts, and New York real estate ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=The%20Taiwanchik,through%20shell%20companies%20and%20bank)) ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=accounts%20in%20Cyprus%3B%20and%20of,hedge%20funds%20and%20real%20estate)).** Notably, this case (U.S. v. Taiwanchik-Trincher) revealed that a high-stakes illegal gambling enterprise catering to Russian oligarchs was being run out of a condo in Trump Tower – literally within Trump’s flagship property. FBI surveillance at Trump Tower in 2011–2013 (related to this case) led to the takedown of kingpin Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov’s network ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=The%20Taiwanchik,New%20York%20for%20his%20alleged)). The **DOJ’s press release** detailed how **tens of millions from Russia and Ukraine were funneled through Cyprus shell companies into the U.S. and then invested in hedge funds and real estate ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=primarily%20to%20Russian%20oligarchs%20living,was%20either%20laundered%20through%20additional)) ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=accounts%20in%20Cyprus%3B%20and%20of,hedge%20funds%20and%20real%20estate))**. Although Trump was not implicated in the crimes, the fact that his building was chosen as a base underscores how attractive Trump-branded real estate was to Russian mobsters seeking cover in the West. 

Another example is the **Prevezon Holdings case (2013–2017)**, which involved a Russian company accused of laundering part of the $230 million tax fraud exposed by Sergei Magnitsky. U.S. prosecutors alleged Prevezon **purchased luxury Manhattan condos with proceeds of Russian corruption** to wash the funds ([U.S. settles Russian money laundering case | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case-idUSKBN18904N/#:~:text=settlement%20is%20the%20amount%20it,cost%20to%20try%20the%20case)) ([U.S. settles Russian money laundering case | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case-idUSKBN18904N/#:~:text=U,of%20the%20companies%20admitted%20wrongdoing)). The case was settled in 2017 with Prevezon paying \$5.9 million ([U.S. settles Russian money laundering case | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case-idUSKBN18904N/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%28Reuters%29%20,set%20to%20go%20to%20trial)), but it highlighted the scheme: money stolen in Russia ended up in New York real estate. Notably, one of Prevezon’s attorneys was Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had also approached the Trump campaign in 2016 – illustrating how these money-laundering operations and political influence efforts can intersect. Western governments are now keenly aware of this pattern. The U.S. Treasury’s FinCEN in recent years imposed rules targeting anonymous luxury home purchases (the “Geographic Targeting Orders”) precisely because of **concerns that kleptocrats, including Russians, pour illicit money into American real estate**.  

**Strength of Evidence:** The historical pattern of Russian organized crime exploiting real estate is essentially uncontested – it’s supported by court records, law enforcement statements, and policy responses. The FBI, DOJ, and international partners have multiple convictions and settlements (like the Trincher case, Prevezon case) showing this scheme in action ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=primarily%20to%20Russian%20oligarchs%20living,was%20either%20laundered%20through%20additional)) ([U.S. settles Russian money laundering case | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-settles-russian-money-laundering-case-idUSKBN18904N/#:~:text=U,of%20the%20companies%20admitted%20wrongdoing)). Experts in transnational crime, such as professor Louise Shelley or journalist Oliver Bullough, have published extensively on how **billions in dirty Russian money have been parked in London townhouses, Miami condos, and the like**. This provides a credible *modus operandi*: when we see a surge of cash buyers from the former USSR in Trump’s properties, it fits a larger trend and is not a coincidence. Even **members of Trump’s own party** acknowledged this context – in 2017, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to the DHS raising concerns that **“Russian oligarchs and operatives may be using condos in the U.S. (including Trump-branded properties) to launder funds”** (paraphrased from his public letter). The broad acknowledgment of this money-laundering pipeline strengthens the plausibility that Trump’s businesses were at times part of that pipeline, whether wittingly or unwittingly.  

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** The historical evidence establishes the *method*, but not every instance of foreign investment is illicit. The challenge is distinguishing legitimate Russian buyers from criminal ones – a nuance sometimes lost in public discourse. In Trump’s case, while we know Russian money flowed in, determining what percentage was criminal versus legitimate wealth is difficult without full financial disclosure. Moreover, while we can cite cases where Russian criminals laundered money via real estate, **connecting those specifically to Trump (beyond the ones noted) relies on investigative reporting rather than completed prosecutions**. For instance, many Russian buyers in Trump buildings have profiles (businesspeople, minor officials) that raise eyebrows but have not been charged with crimes. Thus, one uncertainty is the extent of *organized crime* involvement versus simply wealthy Russians seeking asset havens. In any event, the prevalence of the tactic and Trump’s openness to opaque buyers created a high-risk environment. The gap isn’t whether the pattern exists – it does – but rather in proving any given Trump deal was definitively a corrupt transaction. That said, the pattern substantially raises the **probability** that at least some were, and it contextualizes why investigators (and Craig Unger’s research) focus so much on Trump’s real estate when probing Russian mob activity.  

## Specific Transactions Linking Trump Businesses and Russian Actors  
To illustrate the above in concrete terms, here are **specific known transactions** involving Trump businesses and Russian or post-Soviet individuals/entities that are frequently cited as suspicious:  

- **1984: Trump Tower Condo Purchases by Russian Mobster.** Soviet émigré **David Bogatin**, linked to Russian organized crime, bought five luxury condos in Trump Tower for ~$6 million cash ([Book Alleges Trump is Compromised by Russian Mafia](https://therealnews.com/book-alleges-trump-is-compromised-by-russian-mafia#:~:text=over%20two%20hundred%20documents%2C%20and,crown%20jewel%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20empire)). In 1987, he fled the U.S. after pleading guilty in a major mafia-run fuel tax scam. U.S. authorities **seized Bogatin’s Trump Tower condos, deeming them laundered assets** – he had explicitly used Trump property to hide illicit proceeds ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI)). This early sale established a *direct* tie between Trump’s premier property and Russian criminal money.  

- **1990s: Russian Mob Boss Ivankov in Trump Tower.** FBI surveillance in the mid-90s found that **Vyacheslav “Yaponchik” Ivankov**, a top Russian mafia boss, was living in Trump Tower while on the run ([Book Alleges Trump is Compromised by Russian Mafia](https://therealnews.com/book-alleges-trump-is-compromised-by-russian-mafia#:~:text=Book%20Alleges%20Trump%20is%20Compromised,They%20thought%20he%20lived)). Ivankov was arrested by the FBI in 1995 (and later convicted) for a U.S. extortion scheme. The fact that Ivankov chose Trump’s building as his residence/base underscores how the property attracted figures of Russia’s criminal underworld (though records suggest he was a tenant, not an owner).  

- **2008: Palm Beach Mansion Flip to Russian Oligarch.** In July 2008, Donald Trump sold **“Maison de L’Amitié,” his Palm Beach estate, to Dmitry Rybolovlev for \$95 million**, the most expensive U.S. home sale ever at the time ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=larger%20six,estate%20record%20at%20the%20time)). Trump had purchased it for about \$41 million just four years earlier ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%20bought%20the%20land%20where,estate%20record%20at%20the%20time)). Rybolovlev (a fertilizer billionaire with Kremlin connections) never lived in the house – he demolished it and later sold the subdivided land ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Rybolovlev%2C%20who%20made%20his%20estimated,lots%2C%20and%20selling%20them%20off)). The **extraordinary \$54 million markup** paid to Trump raised suspicions of potential money laundering or a hidden payoff. Senate Finance Committee investigators and Special Counsel Mueller reportedly reviewed this transaction ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%27s%20sale%20of%20the%20land,or%20at%20any%20other%20time)). Both Trump and Rybolovlev insist it was a normal deal and that they never met in person ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%27s%20sale%20of%20the%20land,or%20at%20any%20other%20time)). **Assessment:** The deal pumped a huge amount of cash into Trump’s hands during the 2008 financial crisis; while no illegality was proven, experts like Christopher Steele flagged it as the kind of opaque transaction warranting scrutiny ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%27s%20sale%20of%20the%20land,or%20at%20any%20other%20time)).  

- **2010s: Trump Ocean Club Panama – Narco and Mafia Money.** The Trump Ocean Club in Panama City (opened 2011) was a licensing deal that became a **haven for money launderers**. A Global Witness investigation found **colombian drug trafficker David Murcia Guzmán laundered narcotics cash by buying Trump Ocean Club condos via a fixer ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Investor%20spotlight%3A%20David%20Helmut%20Murcia,Guzm%C3%A1n)) ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=David%20Helmut%20Murcia%20Guzm%C3%A1n%20is,reported%20ties%20to%20armed%20groups))**. Separately, Panamanian brokers for the project revealed that **many units were bought by Russian buyers with questionable backgrounds – some later identified as Russian mob figures ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Attracting%20Russian%20and%20Eastern%20European,posed%20major%20money%20laundering%20risks)) ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=In%20his%20interview%20with%20NBC,part%20of%20the%20Russian%20Mafia)).** One broker who sold dozens of Trump units, Alexandre Ventura, later fled Panama and said, *“I had some customers with… questionable backgrounds. I eventually discovered some were part of the Russian mafia.”* Trump had no direct role in day-to-day sales, but **he earned millions in licensing fees while brokers courted such buyers** ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Rich%20Russians%20%E2%80%93%20whom%20he,Stearns%20to%20develop%20the%20project)) ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=,Great%20buyers)). **Assessment:** This case shows a Trump-branded project integrally involved in international money laundering. It demonstrates the risk of Trump’s business model: he profited from sales **even when the funds were illicit**, and those criminal buyers gained a luxury asset to clean their money.  

- **2006–2013: Trump SoHo and Bayrock Group Deals.** Trump SoHo in New York was a hotel-condo project developed by Bayrock Group (run by Soviet-born investors Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater) in partnership with the Trump Organization. **Felix Sater** had a notorious past – a **conviction for a $40 million stock fraud orchestrated by Russian mafia gangs ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%20,informant%20for%20the%20Federal))** – yet became a senior business adviser to Trump. Bayrock, by its own partners’ later admissions, took in capital from mysterious sources in Russia and Kazakhstan ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=convinced%20that%20the%20firm%20was,a%20front%20for%20money%20laundering)). A 2017 lawsuit and leaked financial records allege that **Bayrock and Sater funneled dirty money into Trump projects**. In one instance, a Kazakh oligarch’s son, Ilyas Khrapunov, allegedly laundered ~$3 million through *purchase contracts* for three Trump SoHo units (facilitated by Sater) ([Lawsuit says Felix Sater looked to launder cash through Trump ...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/lawsuit-says-felix-sater-looked-to-launder-cash-through-trump-projects#:~:text=,Trump%20SoHo%2C%20a%20New)) ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=international%20money%20laundering%20scheme%20involving,11)). Emails show Sater also tried to secure financing from Russian investors for a Trump Tower Moscow project in 2015, hinting at his continued Russia ties ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=international%20money%20laundering%20scheme%20involving,11)). **Assessment:** Trump SoHo’s developers and some financing were deeply entangled with people connected to Eurasian organized crime. While Trump mostly lent his name and got a cut of profits, his choice of partners (Bayrock/Sater) linked him indirectly to money laundering operations. This specific nexus is one of the stronger pieces of evidence tying Trump’s business to organized crime activity, as it is backed by court documents and Sater’s known history ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%20,informant%20for%20the%20Federal)).  

- **2013: Illegal Gambling Ring in Trump Tower.** As noted, in 2013 U.S. prosecutors busted a **Russian-American mob gambling ring headquartered in a Trump Tower apartment**. The high-roller ring, run by mobsters Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov (still a fugitive) and Vadim Trincher, laundered over \$100 million from Russia through shell companies and real estate investments ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=The%20Taiwanchik,through%20shell%20companies%20and%20bank)) ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=accounts%20in%20Cyprus%3B%20and%20of,hedge%20funds%20and%20real%20estate)). Trincher, who **owned a 63rd-floor Trump Tower condo**, pled guilty to racketeering. Court filings detail how **at least \$50 million of Russian gambling proceeds flowed through Cyprus and into the U.S., including into luxury condos and other assets ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=primarily%20to%20Russian%20oligarchs%20living,was%20either%20laundered%20through%20additional)) ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=accounts%20in%20Cyprus%3B%20and%20of,hedge%20funds%20and%20real%20estate)).** **Assessment:** This case, while not involving Trump business operations directly, literally took place under Trump’s roof. It starkly illustrates how Russian crime figures used Trump’s property for both operations and laundering – reinforcing the broader claim that such properties were a magnet for dirty money. It also shows that law enforcement *caught* and documented the scheme, lending credence to similar yet-unprosecuted patterns in Trump’s milieu.  

Each of these transactions on its own raised eyebrows; taken together, they paint a consistent picture of Trump’s real estate being disproportionately involved with Russian money – some of it demonstrably criminal, much of it opaque. In many instances, journalists digging into one deal uncovered links to several others, revealing an **extensive network of Russian buyers, financiers, and middlemen surrounding Trump**. Notably, even after Trump became president, reports emerged that suspicious funds might still be flowing: for example, in 2019 _BuzzFeed News_ obtained secret** Suspicious Activity Reports **flagging \$100+ million in transactions tied to Felix Sater and the Trump Tower Moscow effort ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=match%20at%20L575%20Sater%20Must,BuzzFeed%20News.%20October)). This suggests the pattern didn’t stop when Trump took office, though those later allegations remain under investigation.  

**Strength of Evidence:** The specific cases above are backed by hard evidence – property records, court filings, government announcements, and/or the principals’ own statements. They provide **tangible, checkable links** between Trump’s business assets and individuals tied to Russian organized crime or Kremlin-connected oligarchs. The repetition of such links across decades and projects (from New York to Panama) strengthens the argument that it wasn’t mere coincidence but rather a feature of how Trump did business (seeking foreign capital aggressively, with few questions asked). Importantly, several of these transactions directly involve crime (e.g. the Panama laundering, the Trump Tower gambling ring), not just shady reputations, so the paper trail of wrongdoing is clear ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Investor%20spotlight%3A%20David%20Helmut%20Murcia,Guzm%C3%A1n)) ([Two Defendants Sentenced for Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy with Russian-American Organized Crime Enterprise Operating International Sportsbook That Laundered More Than $100 Million — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/two-defendants-sentenced-for-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy-with-russian-american-organized-crime-enterprise-operating-international-sportsbook-that-laundered-more-than-100-million#:~:text=primarily%20to%20Russian%20oligarchs%20living,was%20either%20laundered%20through%20additional)).  

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** With specific transactions, the challenge is often **proving Trump’s knowledge or intent**. Trump and his company have long maintained that a developer can’t realistically vet the ultimate source of every dollar that buys a condo. In cases like Bogatin’s 1984 purchases, Trump’s defenders argue he couldn’t have known the buyer’s criminal ties at the time (Bogatin had no criminal record then). Similarly, the Trump Organization has tried to distance itself: e.g. in response to reports about Panama and SoHo, they noted that **Trump was “just a licensor” not in charge of day-to-day sales** ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=ABC%20News%20later%20quoted%20Alan,not%20fly%20in%20Russian%20journalists)). These denials highlight a gap – while the transactions are real, direct evidence of Trump directing or conspiring in money laundering is not public. Also, some suspicious deals (like the Rybolovlev mansion sale) remain unexplained but also uncharged, leaving a cloud of suspicion but no official conclusion. Thus, uncertainty remains whether some of these were *deliberate* laundering or simply odd market deals. Nevertheless, even absent a smoking gun memo, the **pattern of Trump repeatedly doing business with corrupt actors is strongly substantiated**. The main open question is to what extent this was calculated facilitation or willful blindness in exchange for cash – an ambiguity that only further investigation or Trump’s financial disclosures could resolve.  

## Investigative Reports & Corroboration by Major Outlets  
The allegations above have been extensively investigated by major news organizations, which provide further corroboration and context:

- **Reuters (2017)** – In a special report titled *“Moscow on the Beach,”* Reuters documented nearly \$100 million spent by Russian elites on Trump-branded condos in Florida ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)). The buyers included a former executive of a state-run Russian construction firm (who worked on military/intelligence facilities) and other influential figures ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=One%20wealthy%20Russian%20buyer%20was,an%20online%20real%20estate%20listing)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=From%202013%20to%202016%2C%20Yuzvik,construction%20projects%20at%20military%20facilities)). While noting that none were Kremlin inner-circle members and Trump Org wasn’t accused of wrongdoing, Reuters highlighted how **wealthy Russians used Trump properties to “stow cash” abroad ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=RUSSIAN%20ELITE))**, often via LLCs that obscured identities ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20tally%20of%20investors%20from,not%20included%20in%20the%20tally)). This investigative piece gave mainstream confirmation that Trump’s real estate empire attracted unusual concentrations of Russian money.  

- **The New York Times** – The Times has published numerous articles on Trump’s finances. In 2018, it cited **Donald Trump Jr.’s 2008 remark** that “**Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets**” ([Donald Trump Jr. in 2008 Said a Lot of Trump Assets Were in Russia - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2#:~:text=resurfaced%20on%20Sunday%20in%20a,ed%20article)), using it as a lens to interpret Trump’s Russia-friendly stances. The NYT also reported that anti-money-laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank flagged transactions involving Trump’s accounts and Russian individuals in 2016-2017, suspecting possible illicit activity (though bank executives chose not to file reports) – an example of journalistic uncovering of potential evidence that hasn’t been officially confirmed. Additionally, Times reporters traced Trump’s failed Trump Tower Toronto project, revealing it was partly funded by a Ukrainian-Russian oligarch and that brokers were encouraged to target Russian investors, again underscoring recurring patterns.

- **The Washington Post** – The Post published an in-depth history in 2017 of Trump’s dealings in the former Soviet Union, concluding that **“Trump had spent 30 years courting business deals in Russia, finding partners in oligarchs and developers with shadowy backgrounds”** (paraphrased). WaPo journalists uncovered, for instance, that in the 1990s Trump sought financing from Russia when U.S. banks wouldn’t lend to him, and that by 2006-2008, *“rich Russians were the premier customers for Trump’s properties”*. They also reported that **several Trump-branded projects (Trump Soho, Fort Lauderdale, etc.) involved investors or buyers linked to Russian organized crime** – often referencing legal cases like Bayrock’s. The Post’s coverage corroborated specifics like Sater’s role and Arif’s 2010 arrest (in a Turkish prostitution sting), painting a picture that many of Trump’s partners had serious criminal or Kremlin ties.

- **Bloomberg and Financial Times** – These financial outlets have zeroed in on how foreign capital kept Trump’s enterprises afloat. A Bloomberg piece in 2017 described Trump’s business as having been “rescued by Russian money” in the early 2000s, citing how condo sales in Sunny Isles, FL to Russian investors provided a revenue stream when Trump was over-leveraged. The **Financial Times (2018)** investigated the Trump Soho deal in detail (in *“Tower of Secrets”*), finding that financing had come via Icelandic and post-Soviet intermediaries suspected of money laundering. The FT also interviewed a former Bayrock executive who said he **was convinced Bayrock was a front for Russian money laundering ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=convinced%20that%20the%20firm%20was,a%20front%20for%20money%20laundering))**, but that the full extent was hard to trace due to complex offshore structures. Such reporting in top financial newspapers lends credence to the money laundering claims, given their high standards of proof and libel scrutiny.  

- **The Guardian (2017–2021)** – The Guardian’s reporting (often by Luke Harding) synthesized much of the evidence: they highlighted how **at least 13 people with known or alleged ties to Russian organized crime or espionage met, did business, or interacted with Trump over the years**. In early 2021, _The Guardian_ broke the story of **Yuri Shvets’s revelations** about Trump’s KGB cultivation ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D)), bringing Unger’s research to a broad audience and noting that Trump’s pro-Russia statements in 1987 were viewed as a successful outcome by the KGB. The Guardian also covered newer angles, like how a **Russian-American businessman under criminal probe helped fund Trump’s Truth Social venture in 2021 ([Trump Media saved in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal ...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/03/trump-media-es-family-trust-2022-loans#:~:text=Trump%20Media%20saved%20in%202022,person%20of%20interest%20to%20prosecutors))** – suggesting the theme continues. Their work often ties individual facts into the larger narrative of Russian influence operations.

- **Others:** Numerous other credible outlets – **CNN, BBC, ProPublica, and nonprofit investigators like Global Witness** – have contributed pieces. ProPublica’s *Trump, Inc.* podcast, for example, did an episode on the Taj Mahal AML violations and how regulators had flagged the casino for years ([FinCEN Fines Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort $10 Million for ...](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-fines-trump-taj-mahal-casino-resort-10-million-significant-and-long#:~:text=,violations%20of%20the%20Bank)) ([Trump Taj Mahal casino settles U.S. money laundering claims | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-taj-mahal-casino-settles-us-money-laundering-claims-idUSL1N0VL2L1/#:~:text=In%20exchange%2C%20Trump%20Taj%20Mahal,Act%20from%202010%20to%202012)). Global Witness, as discussed, published a full report on Panama’s Trump Tower, complete with on-record interviews of people involved in the sales (solidifying claims of criminal money there). Each of these reports by itself might focus on one piece of the puzzle, but collectively they reinforce one another. For instance, **Global Witness confirmed on the ground what Reuters quantified from records – that Trump’s brand attracted significant Russian (and criminal) interest abroad ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Attracting%20Russian%20and%20Eastern%20European,posed%20major%20money%20laundering%20risks)) ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=In%20his%20interview%20with%20NBC,part%20of%20the%20Russian%20Mafia))**.

**Strength of Evidence:** The corroboration by independent news organizations is strong. These outlets had no partisan agenda but were following evidence – financial records, court cases, and sources – which led them to remarkably similar conclusions. The repetition of key facts across Reuters, FT, WaPo, NYT, etc. indicates that **the evidence has been cross-checked**. It’s telling that even when Trump was President (and presumably subject to intense scrutiny), no refutation emerged disproving these reported links. Instead, Trump Org officials generally responded by downplaying them (e.g. “overblown story” ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=,Legal%20Officer%2C%20The%20Trump%20Organization))) rather than presenting counter-evidence. Major news investigations also often prompted official inquiries. For example, after Reuters and others noted the Russian condo buyers, members of Congress like Senator Ron Wyden pressed for financial transparency ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=Informed%20of%20the%20Reuters%20analysis,greater%20disclosure%20of%20his%20finances)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=the%20Senate%20and%20House%20intelligence,committees%2C%20declined%20to%20comment)). Such reactions show that the reporting was taken seriously. In sum, the media documentation provides a well-substantiated factual backbone for Unger’s claims – ensuring that this narrative isn’t reliant on any single dubious source (like the Steele dossier alone), but on a broad base of verified information.

**Gaps/Uncertainties:** While media reports bring clarity to many facts, they cannot always penetrate the most guarded information – such as Trump’s internal financial records or Russian intelligence files. Thus, some stories use phrases like “likely” or “appears to” when connecting dots that insiders refuse to confirm on record. There is also the risk of **confirmation bias**: journalists often built on each other’s work, so a mistaken premise could conceivably propagate (though there’s no clear example of a major claim above being debunked). To date, no outlet has found a document explicitly linking Trump to a Russian intelligence payoff or a direct order to launder money – those implications are drawn from patterns and circumstantial evidence. The biggest uncertainty the media highlights is **motive**: we know the transactions and ties happened, but *why* Trump welcomed so many dubious partners remains a matter of interpretation (strategic collusion vs. simple financial desperation). Nonetheless, investigative reporting has greatly narrowed the scope of debate: it established that **the connections and financial flows were real**. Any remaining gaps are mostly about how to legally characterize them (collusion, corruption, or coincidence) and whether more hidden details will emerge from archives or ongoing probes.  

## Conclusion & Context  
The assembled evidence – from financial records and legal cases to intelligence sources and investigative journalism – provides a detailed and disturbing portrait of Donald Trump’s long-running interactions with Russian organized crime figures and influence agents. **In terms of money laundering**, the evidence is robust that Trump properties were used repeatedly to wash funds, whether via the sale of high-dollar condos to known criminals (e.g. Bogatin’s purchases ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI))) or through business partnerships that brought in illicit cash (e.g. Bayrock’s financing of Trump SoHo ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=convinced%20that%20the%20firm%20was,a%20front%20for%20money%20laundering))). What remains less certain is the extent of Trump’s awareness or involvement in these schemes – a gap that could potentially be closed by future document releases or testimony. 

**Regarding Russian intelligence efforts**, multiple former officials (from the KGB and CIA alike) attest that Trump was targeted as an asset decades ago ([‘Donald Trump recruited by Moscow in 1980s’, claims ex-KGB officer: Report | World News - Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-recruited-by-moscow-in-1980s-claims-ex-kgb-officer-report-101740303642133.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20a%20former%20KGB,western%20propaganda%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)). His behavior and Russia’s overt interference on his behalf in 2016 are consistent with such a cultivated relationship, though definitive proof (in the form of, say, a KGB recruitment file) hasn’t been produced publicly. The strength of this claim lies in the convergence of independent narratives: the KGB angle explains Trump’s pro-Russia tilt dating back to 1987, while the 2016 intelligence findings confirm Russia’s keen interest in Trump’s ascendance ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama | Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=since%20he%20became%20President,elect%20Donald%20Trump.%E2%80%9D)). Still, without declassified records, a degree of uncertainty will persist, and reasonable skeptics can argue Trump’s conduct might stem from personal affinity or business considerations rather than explicit “handling” by Moscow. 

**Experts and investigators largely agree on the core facts**: Donald Trump’s business empire became deeply entangled with Russian and post-Soviet money streams at a time when those streams were rife with criminality and Kremlin influence. As a result, Trump was surrounded by people who were either directly part of Russian mafia networks, or who had strong ties to Russian financial and political power (and in several cases, both). This created a fertile ground for compromise. Financial crime specialists see compelling signs of money laundering, and veteran intelligence officers see a classic cultivation operation. Journalists have substantiated many of these specifics, though some questions can only be answered with subpoena power or foreign cooperation that journalists lack. 

In sum, each major claim in Craig Unger’s research is backed by credible evidence, though with varying degrees of completeness. The **claim of extensive money laundering through Trump properties** is supported by numerous concrete examples and legal findings, making it very strong overall – the gap lies mainly in proving Trump’s intent. The **claim of Russian intelligence cultivation** is supported by expert testimony and Trump’s correlated behavior, making it plausible and even likely in the eyes of many observers, but it remains an allegation rather than a proven fact, due to the inherent secrecy of espionage. Crucially, no definitive disproof of these claims has emerged; instead, as more information comes to light, the narrative of long-term synergy between Trump’s interests and Russian mafia/kleptocratic interests has only been reinforced.

**Significance:** The significance of these findings cannot be overstated. They suggest that a U.S. president (and longtime public figure) may have been compromised by foreign illicit interests well before he ran for office. This casts events like the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts in a more ominous light – not as isolated poor judgments, but as part of a **decades-old convergence of Trump’s financial ambitions with Russia’s geopolitical aims**. It also raises national security concerns: if a leader’s fortunes are tied to criminal and foreign networks, his policy decisions (e.g. unusually favorable rhetoric toward Putin, or reluctance to enforce sanctions) might be influenced by those opaque entanglements ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Ever%20since%20his%20presidential%20campaign%2C,for%20political%20murder%2C%20which%20both)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRussian%20efforts%20either%20to%20recruit,Humphrey%20in%20the%201968%20election)). At the very least, these findings underline the importance of financial transparency and vetting for anyone seeking high office. They also illustrate how Russian organized crime and intelligence often work in tandem (organized crime providing the money and coercive leverage, intelligence providing strategy) to penetrate Western institutions – in this case, reaching the pinnacle of U.S. power. 

Finally, it’s worth noting the **evolution of evidence**: what started as scattered reports and rumors years ago has solidified considerably. As one member of Congress put it in 2018, “**it’s all about the money. Follow the laundering and you’ll find the collusion**” – a hypothesis that today is supported by a substantial body of documented facts ([House panel releases transcript of interview with Fusion GPS co-founder - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/18/house-panel-releases-transcript-of-interview-with-fusion-gps-co-founder-346342#:~:text=Simpson%E2%80%99s%20testimony%20%E2%80%9Creveal,Fire%20and%20Fury%2C%E2%80%9D%20Schiff%20said)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=awareness%20that%20Russian%20and%20other,intelligence%20assets%20and%20compromising%20them)). While gaps remain and further investigation is needed (many avenues were left unexplored by Mueller’s limited mandate), the existing evidence presents a troubling mosaic of relationships between Donald Trump, Russian oligarchs, and mob figures. Future historians and prosecutors will likely continue filling in pieces of this puzzle, but the picture painted so far strongly corroborates Craig Unger’s central claims: **Trump’s world and the world of Russian organized crime have been intertwined for decades, with consequences that have rippled from Trump Tower to the White House**.
